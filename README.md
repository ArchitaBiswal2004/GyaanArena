# Rural STEM Learning Platform - MVP

A gamified digital learning platform designed to enhance STEM education for rural students (grades 6-12) with offline capabilities, multilingual support, and teacher analytics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Students in rural areas often lack access to quality STEM education resources due to limited internet connectivity and language barriers.

### Solution
An offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides interactive STEM games in multiple languages, works on low-cost devices, and tracks student progress for teachers.

### Expected Outcomes
- **15% increase in student engagement**
- **Works offline after initial load**
- **Supports multiple languages (English & Hindi)**
- **Runs on low-cost devices**
- **Teacher dashboard with analytics**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rural-edu-platform
```

2. **Serve the application**
   
   Using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   
   Using Node.js:
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   
   Using VS Code Live Server:
   - Install the Live Server extension
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

3. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### For Production Deployment

1. **Deploy to any static hosting service:**
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - GitHub Pages
   - Firebase Hosting
   - Any web server (Apache, Nginx)

2. **HTTPS is required for:**
   - Service Worker functionality
   - PWA installation
   - Full offline capabilities

## 🌍 Localization

### Adding New Languages

1. Create a new translation file in `locales/` directory
2. Add language option to the selector in `index.html`
3. Translations are automatically loaded

Example translation structure:
```json
{
  "app.title": "Your Translation",
  "tabs.home": "Home Translation",
  ...
}
```
